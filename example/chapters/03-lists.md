# Creating and Importing a List

The foundation of great email marketing is a clean, updated, engaged list of subscribers. Once you’ve [created](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup), confirmed, and logged in to your MailChimp account, you’re ready to start building that list. 

You can create as many lists as you’d like within your account, but for most users, we recommend [maintaining a single list](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/growth/best-practices-for-lists) along with [segmenting data](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/groups-and-segments/getting-started-with-segments) and [interest groups](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/groups-and-segments/add-groups-to-a-list), as needed. This helps keep your list clean and your billing rate low, since our [monthly rates](http://mailchimp.com/pricing/growing-business/) are determined by your total subscriber count. Duplicate subscribers across multiple lists count toward that total. 

## Creating your list

To [create a list in your MailChimp account](http://eepurl.com/gOHY), follow these steps:

1. Choose **Lists** from your MailChimp dashboard, then click the **Create List** button in the upper righthand corner.
2. On the **List details** page, you can choose a name for the list, set the default From name and email address, and write a short “permission reminder” to remind your subscribers how and why they’re receiving email from you.
3. When you’re finished, click **Save**. 

If you don’t have any subscribers yet, don’t worry! MailChimp will automatically generate a signup form for your list, which you can easily [customize](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/create-signup-forms-and-response-emails), [share](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/share-your-signup-form), [post on your website](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website), or even [add to your Facebook page](http://kb.mailchimp.com/integrations/facebook/add-a-signup-form-to-your-facebook-page). We give you lots of options when you’re building the form, so you can gather exactly the information you need from your contacts. You can also use this information to [segment your list](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/groups-and-segments/getting-started-with-segments) later on.

At MailChimp, we’re serious about security and sending reputations—yours and ours. By default, our signup forms require double opt-in, which helps maintain the integrity of your mailing list and can improve email deliverability and performance. For more information about the double opt-in process, refer to [this article](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/the-double-opt-in-process).

## Importing your list

If you have an existing list of contacts or subscribers who have [opted-in to receiving email from you](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/compliance-tips/examples-of-compliant-and-non-compliant-lists), there are several different options for [importing them into MailChimp](http://eepurl.com/gOH5). They include:
 
- Uploading a CSV or tab delimited text file
- Copying and pasting your list from Excel
- Importing contacts from your Mac Address Book with the help of our [Chimport app](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/growth/use-chimport-to-export-mac-address-book-contacts)
- Importing directly from a third-party application or program—like Salesforce, Google Docs, or Highrise—that integrates with MailChimp. For more details about our available integrations, visit our [Integrations Directory](http://connect.mailchimp.com/). If your contacts are stored in an application or program that doesn’t currently integrate with MailChimp, refer to that program’s support documentation or customer support team for assistance with getting a CSV file of the contacts.
- Importing contacts using [MailChimp’s API](http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/). (A quick warning here: the API is for _experienced programmers and developers_. If you don’t currently have someone on staff that can assist with this, consider reaching out to one of our for-hire, third-party [MailChimp Experts](https://experts.mailchimp.com/) to lend a hand.)

Do you only need to add a single email address to your list? You can do so by clicking the [_add subscriber_ icon on the Lists page](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/growth/add-individual-subscribers-to-a-list).
