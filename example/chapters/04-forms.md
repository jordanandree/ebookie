# Building and customizing signup forms

When you create a list in MailChimp, we’ll automatically generate a series of signup forms and response emails. You can use the tools on the **Create forms** page to customize the **Unsubscribe** sequence, the **Update profile** sequence, and other list forms and emails that make up our double opt-in process. MailChimp forms are mobile-responsive, so potential subscribers can easily view and submit their information from a smartphone or other mobile device. 

Below, we'll cover the basic steps for creating and designing general forms in MailChimp, but there are a few other options on the **Signup forms** page for each list as well. 

- **Embedded forms** - Generate HTML code for a form that can be embedded on your website or blog. Learn about the embedded form options [here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website#Embed-Form-options).
- **Subscriber popup form** The [subscriber popup](http://eepurl.com/94dz9) is a customizable form option that automatically displays a MailChimp signup form in a popup modal on your website shortly after someone visits the page. 
- **Form integrations** - Build sophisticated forms and connect MailChimp to your blog and social media profiles. Integrations with Wufoo, CoffeeCup, Twitter, WordPress, and Squarespace are available here, too.
- **Facebook form** - Add a signup form to your Facebook page.
- **Tablet form** - Collect signups in your brick-and-mortar store or at events with Chimpadeedoo for [iPad](http://kb.mailchimp.com/mobile/chimpadeedoo-for-ipad) or [Android](http://kb.mailchimp.com/mobile/chimpadeedoo-for-android) tablets.

## Build it

To build your signup form and begin customizing:

1. Navigate to the **Lists** page.
2. Select the appropriate list.
3. From within that list page, click **Signup forms**, then **General forms**.
4. Click the **Build it** tab.
5. All forms start out with three default fields: **Email address**, **First name**, and **Last name**. If you’ve imported a list containing additional fields, they'll be present on the form as well. To add extra fields, choose a field type from the **Add a field** tab on the right side of the page.
6. Once you've added any extra fields you need, you can customize field text and [set default merge field values](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/managing-subscribers/set-default-merge-values-for-a-list).
7. Click **Save & Exit** to save all changes to your form.

**Note:** If you would like to add an extra layer of security to your form, check the **Protect your signup form with reCAPTCHA** box on the **Create forms** page. When this option is enabled, a [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html) checkbox that says "I'm not a robot." will be included on your signup form, preventing spam bots from adding email addresses to your list.

## Design it

To the right of the **Build it** is the **Design it** tab. Here, you can choose the colors, styles, and fonts for the form or response email you've selected. It's important to note that style changes are made universally and not form by form. When you edit or make a change to any element of the form, we apply the same change to each of the other forms and response emails for your list.

## Translate it

Use the **Translate it** tab to [enable or customize translations](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/translate-signup-forms-and-emails) for your list's forms and response emails in any of MailChimp's 40+ supported languages. 

**Note:** The subscriber popup form does **not** support translation.
