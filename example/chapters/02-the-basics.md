# The Basics

MailChimp is a web-based application that [works in most web browsers](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/account-setup/minimum-system-requirements), which means you don’t need to download or install any new software on your computer. To make sure that MailChimp works properly in your browser, you should enable cookies, pop-ups, and JavaScript. Before you watch our tutorial videos, you’ll need the [latest version of Flash](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/). 

## Compliance tips

When you create a MailChimp account, you agree to [comply with all anti-spam regulations](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/compliance-tips/terms-of-use-and-anti-spam-requirements-for-campaigns) and MailChimp’s [Terms Of Use](http://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/). These terms require that all lists be permission-based, consisting of subscribers who signed up through a mailing list signup form or gave explicit permission for you to add them to the list. You must have tangible, confirmable proof that the subscriber wants you to communicate with them. Be mindful of these guidelines as you’re getting started:

- Make sure the intent of the signup form is clearly stated. All potential subscribers should understand that, by submitting their contact information through the form, they are agreeing to receive bulk email from you.
- “Contact Us,” “Apply For A Quote,” or “More Information” forms are not considered an acceptable opt-in method for bulk emails. These forms generally indicate a one-to-one email, not permission to be added to a bulk mailing list.    
- Email addresses collected verbally, from personal address books, from business cards, or from social media/LinkedIn followers are not considered viable opt-in methods, due to their lack of tangible, verifiable proof of consent.
- While it’s _generally_ okay to add existing customers to a bulk mailing list, they must be recent customers (having purchased a product in the past 6 months) or customers that have already been regularly receiving emails from you. Only use addresses that have requested to be added to a list.
- We do not allow any kind of [third party lists](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/compliance-tips/third-party-purchased-or-rented-lists) in our system. This includes publicly available, purchased, rented, or partner lists.
