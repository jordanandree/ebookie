# Creating and Importing a List

The foundation of great email marketing is a clean, updated, engaged list of subscribers. Once you’ve [created](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup), confirmed, and logged in to your MailChimp account, you’re ready to start building that list. 

You can create as many lists as you’d like within your account, but for most users, we recommend [maintaining a single list](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/growth/best-practices-for-lists) along with [segmenting data](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/groups-and-segments/getting-started-with-segments) and [interest groups](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/groups-and-segments/add-groups-to-a-list), as needed. This helps keep your list clean and your billing rate low, since our [monthly rates](http://mailchimp.com/pricing/growing-business/) are determined by your total subscriber count. Duplicate subscribers across multiple lists count toward that total. 

## Creating your list

To [create a list in your MailChimp account](http://eepurl.com/gOHY), follow these steps:

1. Choose **Lists** from your MailChimp dashboard, then click the **Create List** button in the upper righthand corner.
2. On the **List details** page, you can choose a name for the list, set the default From name and email address, and write a short “permission reminder” to remind your subscribers how and why they’re receiving email from you.
3. When you’re finished, click **Save**. 

If you don’t have any subscribers yet, don’t worry! MailChimp will automatically generate a signup form for your list, which you can easily [customize](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/create-signup-forms-and-response-emails), [share](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/share-your-signup-form), [post on your website](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website), or even [add to your Facebook page](http://kb.mailchimp.com/integrations/facebook/add-a-signup-form-to-your-facebook-page). We give you lots of options when you’re building the form, so you can gather exactly the information you need from your contacts. You can also use this information to [segment your list](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/groups-and-segments/getting-started-with-segments) later on.

At MailChimp, we’re serious about security and sending reputations—yours and ours. By default, our signup forms require double opt-in, which helps maintain the integrity of your mailing list and can improve email deliverability and performance. For more information about the double opt-in process, refer to [this article](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/the-double-opt-in-process).

## Importing your list

If you have an existing list of contacts or subscribers who have [opted-in to receiving email from you](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/compliance-tips/examples-of-compliant-and-non-compliant-lists), there are several different options for [importing them into MailChimp](http://eepurl.com/gOH5). They include:
 
- Uploading a CSV or tab delimited text file
- Copying and pasting your list from Excel
- Importing contacts from your Mac Address Book with the help of our [Chimport app](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/growth/use-chimport-to-export-mac-address-book-contacts)
- Importing directly from a third-party application or program—like Salesforce, Google Docs, or Highrise—that integrates with MailChimp. For more details about our available integrations, visit our [Integrations Directory](http://connect.mailchimp.com/). If your contacts are stored in an application or program that doesn’t currently integrate with MailChimp, refer to that program’s support documentation or customer support team for assistance with getting a CSV file of the contacts.
- Importing contacts using [MailChimp’s API](http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/). (A quick warning here: the API is for _experienced programmers and developers_. If you don’t currently have someone on staff that can assist with this, consider reaching out to one of our for-hire, third-party [MailChimp Experts](https://experts.mailchimp.com/) to lend a hand.)

Do you only need to add a single email address to your list? You can do so by clicking the [_add subscriber_ icon on the Lists page](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/growth/add-individual-subscribers-to-a-list). 

# Building and customizing signup forms

When you create a list in MailChimp, we’ll automatically generate a series of signup forms and response emails. You can use the tools on the **Create forms** page to customize the **Unsubscribe** sequence, the **Update profile** sequence, and other list forms and emails that make up our double opt-in process. MailChimp forms are mobile-responsive, so potential subscribers can easily view and submit their information from a smartphone or other mobile device. 

Below, we'll cover the basic steps for creating and designing general forms in MailChimp, but there are a few other options on the **Signup forms** page for each list as well. 

- **Embedded forms** - Generate HTML code for a form that can be embedded on your website or blog. Learn about the embedded form options [here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website#Embed-Form-options).
- **Subscriber popup form** The [subscriber popup](http://eepurl.com/94dz9) is a customizable form option that automatically displays a MailChimp signup form in a popup modal on your website shortly after someone visits the page. 
- **Form integrations** - Build sophisticated forms and connect MailChimp to your blog and social media profiles. Integrations with Wufoo, CoffeeCup, Twitter, WordPress, and Squarespace are available here, too.
- **Facebook form** - Add a signup form to your Facebook page.
- **Tablet form** - Collect signups in your brick-and-mortar store or at events with Chimpadeedoo for [iPad](http://kb.mailchimp.com/mobile/chimpadeedoo-for-ipad) or [Android](http://kb.mailchimp.com/mobile/chimpadeedoo-for-android) tablets.

## Build it

To build your signup form and begin customizing:

1. Navigate to the **Lists** page.
2. Select the appropriate list.
3. From within that list page, click **Signup forms**, then **General forms**.
4. Click the **Build it** tab.
5. All forms start out with three default fields: **Email address**, **First name**, and **Last name**. If you’ve imported a list containing additional fields, they'll be present on the form as well. To add extra fields, choose a field type from the **Add a field** tab on the right side of the page.
6. Once you've added any extra fields you need, you can customize field text and [set default merge field values](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/managing-subscribers/set-default-merge-values-for-a-list).
7. Click **Save & Exit** to save all changes to your form.

**Note:** If you would like to add an extra layer of security to your form, check the **Protect your signup form with reCAPTCHA** box on the **Create forms** page. When this option is enabled, a [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html) checkbox that says "I'm not a robot." will be included on your signup form, preventing spam bots from adding email addresses to your list.

## Design it

To the right of the **Build it** is the **Design it** tab. Here, you can choose the colors, styles, and fonts for the form or response email you've selected. It's important to note that style changes are made universally and not form by form. When you edit or make a change to any element of the form, we apply the same change to each of the other forms and response emails for your list.

Visit our Knowledge Base for more tips on customizing the look and feel of your [list forms and response emails](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/create-signup-forms-and-response-emails).


## Translate it

Use the **Translate it** tab to [enable or customize translations](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/translate-signup-forms-and-emails) for your list's forms and response emails in any of MailChimp's 40+ supported languages. 

**Note:** The subscriber popup form does **not** support translation.
